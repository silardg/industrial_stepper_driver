# Notes
- the idea for this project comes from creating a stepper motor controller
- as stepper motors are mostly used in industrial systems, the case should be a DIN rail mountable
- the driver from trinamic was chosen as its one of the flagship versions that they have with extra features
- adding 5.08mm pitch screw terminals for the stepper and the power supply connections
- adding a JST for the encoder
- adding 2.54mm connector (6 in total connections) for other and communication
- added a filter and schmitt trigger to the encoder
- added advanced filter for the output on the driver stepper
- connecting all pins to the mcu (uart and spi)
- connector jst - CANH CANL GND RS485-A RS485-B GND
- tuning the efuse with three different resistors to get the 10v UVLO and OVLO of 36V
